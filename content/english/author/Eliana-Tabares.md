Biologist, with particular interest in the areas of genetics and conservation. I consider myself a person in constant learning, always in search of new topics and areas of knowledge from which to enrich myself and take advantage of them. One of the things that I like the most is sharing the knowledge learned within my profession, because I consider that scientific dissemination and environmental education are the best ways to reach all the people who are interested in this vast world of biology. Among my favorite activities is discovering new places in which I seek to fully connect with the natural environment and admire it in its maximum splendor.
