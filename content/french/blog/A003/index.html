<blockquote>
<p>To start this adventure, the first thing you need is to install <res>R</res> and <res>Rstudio</res>, without them I think it would be very difficult to start our adventure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that we need both of them, R because it is a programming language and also software; and Rstudio for their valuable development environment.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>What else do we need? Willingness to learn, dedication and patience, yes, patience!</p>
<p>Now you can calmly continue to install these wonders, you will not regret it! It is nothing that we do not know how to do now … Next, next, next … here we will be waiting impatiently for you.</p>

<p>Ready! We assume that everything is already installed and we feel like children with new toys. We want you to become more familiar with Rstudio, as it is more user-friendly; In addition, it has a much prettier interface than R, it also has many shortcuts, hotkeys, and web assistance.</p>
<blockquote>
After installing Rstudio and opening it you should be seeing something like this:

<p>In case you have any problems or did not get a result similar to this, you can watch the following video tutorial on YouTube. From my point of view it is a very interesting channel</p>

<p>Well, now a quick review by RStudio … let’s remember that the RStudio interface is made up of 4 areas or panels that fulfill a certain function and that we can rearrange from the appearance options</p>

<p>The <res>window 1</res> will be our faithful friend, since there we will spend most of our time organizing and editing our command lines written in R language and running them using <res>CONTROL + ENTER</res>. all our lines of code will be transformed into scripts, which will allow us to automate our processes more and more.</p>

<p>The <res>Window 3</res> is where the magic happens, all kinds of magic, from installing libraries, to adding, subtracting, dividing, empowering, endless activities, because that’s where the R code is executed; However, not everything that comes out of there is wonders, it is also where the <res>ERROR</res> and warning messages will come out that annoy our lives a bit</p>

<p>With our program installed, we can start to see what its characteristics are, from options to visual themes. Now we will tell you about an important issue that you must take into account when handling R.</p>
<div id="most-common-data-types-and-data-structure-in-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Most common data types and data structure in R</h2>
<p>From my point of view, understanding or keeping in mind that there are different types of data and that the structure of the data in R also varies, will allow you to save yourself a lot of problems, it is serious, if you want you can write down in your notebook, because as long as you understand this , things that will come from now on will be much easier for you.</p>
<div id="type-of-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Type of data</h3>
<p>I will try to summarize everything for you in a table, initially we can think of seven (7) types of data which are:</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>The topic about <res>data structure and some examples that help us understand these two topics</res> with which we usually work in R we will leave it for another post</p>

<div id="in-conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>First, we have our new toy installed and how do we learn to use a new toy? The answer is very, very simple, <res>PLAYING WITH HIM!</res> I’ll leave you a good book on R below for you to enjoy, but don’t worry, it’s in Spanish; Besides, there is nothing to worry about, here we will explain what you need to know.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>As a second conclusion, we saw that there are <res>7 types of data in R!</res>, did you know? Comment your answer and leave us your conclusions</p>
<p>Finally, how could you see, the data types in R are very simple, they are nothing strange, or anything that we cannot understand, but then we ask ourselves … How am I going to know what types of data I have? … and well we tell you:</p>
