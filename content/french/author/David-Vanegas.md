I'm a biologist, lover of insects. I consider myself a person passionate about life, therefore, I enjoy all the activities related to it, such as research and tourism, which allows us to understand the different natural processes and establish contact with reality. I love doing activities in natural spaces, especially the high mountains, since it is a space where people can reconnect with themselves and understand the true value of what we call life. "Sharing" is one of the words that I believe are key to human development and therefore, I work daily to improve in this sense and to be able to contribute positively to our natural environment.
